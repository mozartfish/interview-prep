# Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
# Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
#  Return k.
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        i = 0
        k = 0
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] == val:
                i += 1 
            else:
                nums[k] = nums[i]
                i += 1 
                k += 1 
        
        return k
